North Star Metrics (The Compass)

StudioVault is a Studio Operating System.
Success is measured not by “features shipped”, but by studios delivering faster,
getting paid reliably, and giving clients a premium experience.

---

1. Core Growth Priority (Phase 1)

StudioVault optimizes in this order:

1. Growth (New Branches Onboarded)
2. Usage (Projects & Deliveries Run Through StudioVault)
3. Revenue (Subscription + Platform Processing Fees)

Revenue is downstream of operational dependence.

2. The Single North Star Metric (Wall Metric)

Client Satisfaction Score (CSS)

Definition:
- The average post-delivery satisfaction rating collected from clients
  after a project is marked Delivered.

Why this is the North Star:
- Photographers survive on reputation.
- If clients are delighted, studios retain, upgrade, and refer others.
- “Premium feel” becomes measurable reality.

Proxy Outcomes Driven by CSS:
- Higher repeat bookings
- Higher review conversion
- Lower refund/dispute rates

3. Active Project Definition (Critical Enforcement)

Active Projects are the unit that consumes system capacity
(Free tier caps, resource locks, workflow load).

A Project becomes ACTIVE when any of the following occurs:

Offline Flow (POS / Clerk Booking)
- A staff member creates and confirms a booking manually
→ Immediate ACTIVE state (hard calendar lock)

Online Flow (Inquiry → Booking)
- Photographer explicitly accepts the project
OR
- Client pays the required advance payment

A Project is NOT Active when:
- Status = Inquiry only (no acceptance, no payment)
- Status = Completed + Archived

This prevents free-tier abuse via unlimited inquiries.

---

4. Retention Metric (Monthly)

Retention is measured at the Branch level first.

Metric:
Monthly Branch Retention (MBR)

Definition:
- % of Branches active in Month N that remain active in Month N+1

Why:
- Branch churn is the earliest signal of product failure or weak onboarding.

---

5. Revenue Metric (Primary Business Engine)

StudioVault revenue is defined as:

Platform Revenue = Subscription Revenue + Payment Processing Fee Cut

We do NOT optimize for GMV alone.
GMV matters only if it produces sustainable platform revenue.

---

6. Product Success Metrics (How We Prove Value)

Studios must feel operationally faster and more premium.

1. Faster Delivery Time
Metric:
Median Days from Shoot → Delivery Portal Ready

2. Client Satisfaction
Metric:
Client Satisfaction Score (1–5 Stars)

3. Review Engine Conversion
Metric:
% of Happy Clients (4–5★) who leave a Google Review

Premium experience is measurable, not subjective.

---

7. Operational Health Metric (Minimal but Essential)

Operational metric required in Phase 1:

Booking Conflict Rate

Definition:
- % of booking attempts rejected due to locked resources

Goal:
- Maintain near-zero double booking incidents.

This is the platform’s operational credibility.

---

8. Upgrade & Expansion Metric

Free-to-Paid Conversion is a core growth lever.

Metric:
Upgrade Rate (30-Day)

Definition:
- % of Free Branches that convert to Paid within 30 days of first Active Project

Primary upgrade triggers:
- Storage limits
- Active project cap
- Branding removal (white-label)

---

9. Long-Term Strategic Outcome

StudioVault’s long-term moat is:

Premium Studio Infrastructure in Flexible Plans

Measurable Proof:
- High Client Satisfaction
- High Branch Retention
- Natural expansion from Branch → Organization plans
