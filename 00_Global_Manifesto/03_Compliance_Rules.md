Compliance & Financial Safety

## 1. Payment Routing & Settlement Model (No Wallet)

**Money Handling Principle:**
StudioVault does *not* hold or store user funds.
We do not operate an internal wallet or stored-value system.

**Provider Layer:**
Payments are processed via Razorpay / Cashfree using compliant routing
(nodal/split settlement mechanisms where required).

**Flow:**
1. Customer pays ₹10,000 via StudioVault booking link.
2. Payment gateway processes the transaction.
3. Automated settlement routing occurs:

   - Payment Gateway Fee (~2.5%) deducted by provider
   - StudioVault Platform Fee deducted (tier-based)
   - Remaining amount settles directly to the Photographer/Studio bank account

StudioVault never maintains a withdrawable user balance.

**Payouts:**
There is no “withdrawal” feature.
Funds are settled directly through the regulated payment provider.

## 2. Privacy & Data Ownership

**Client Data Scope:**
Client data belongs to the **Organization (Agency)**, not to individual photographers or freelancers.

**Sharing Rules:**
Branches are siloed by default.

Sharing customer profiles across branches requires explicit Admin consent
via a "Global Client List" toggle.
