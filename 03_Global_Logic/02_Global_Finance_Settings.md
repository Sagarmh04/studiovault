# Global Finance & Expense Management

## 1. The "Expense Tab" Strategy
* **Location:** Organization Settings -> Finance.
* **Philosophy:** **Manual Entry.** We do not automate expenses (too complex).
* **User Action:** Owner/Finance Manager manually inputs "Fixed Costs" per branch.

## 2. Expense Input Module
* **Granularity:** Per Branch.
* **Input Fields:**
    * **Fixed Monthly Cost:** (e.g., Rent, Internet).
    * **Staff Salaries:** (Lump sum or itemized).
    * **Marketing Budget:** (Manual entry).
* **Frequency:** User sets it once; System applies it automatically every month until changed.

## 3. The Profit Calculation Formula
* **Location:** Visible in "Global Pulse" -> "Profitability" Widget.
* **Formula:**
    ```text
    Estimated Profit = (Real-Time Net Sales) - (Fixed Monthly Expenses + Vendor Costs)
    ```
* **Disclaimer:** Labeled clearly as "Estimated Operational Profit" (EBITDA), not "Taxable Net Income".

## 4. Centralized Billing (StudioVault Subscription)
* **One Bill:** The Organization receives a single invoice from StudioVault.
* **Breakdown:**
    * Subscription Fees (e.g., 3 Branches x Pro Plan).
    * Storage Overage (Global usage).
    * SMS/Wallet Top-ups.
* **Payment Source:** Deducted from the "Org Wallet" or Main Credit Card.
