Customer Support & Escalation Model (The Human Backstop)

StudioVault operates in high-emotion, high-deadline environments.

When failures occur, studios do not experience "bugs."
They experience business collapse.

Support is therefore part of the platform infrastructure.

## 1. Support Philosophy

Support is measured by:

- Time to response
- Time to resolution
- Trust preserved under stress

No studio should feel abandoned during critical workflows.

---

## 2. Support Tiers (Phase 1)

### Free Tier Support
Channels:
- Help Center / Documentation
- Email support (best-effort)

Response Target:
- 48–72 hours

Scope:
- Setup questions
- Basic troubleshooting

---

### Pro Tier Support
Channels:
- Priority email support
- WhatsApp support for SEV1 billing/payment issues

Response Target:
- <24 hours

Scope:
- Booking/payment disruptions
- Upload pipeline failures
- Account enforcement clarifications

---

### Agency / Enterprise Support
Channels:
- Dedicated priority queue
- SEV1 real-time escalation via WhatsApp/SMS

Response Target:
- <4 hours for SEV1 incidents

Includes:
- Governance disputes
- Multi-branch operational emergencies
- Compliance-related escalations

---

## 3. Severity-Based Support Routing

StudioVault aligns support with incident severity:

- SEV1: Payments/Bookings/Uploads down
  → Immediate escalation channel

- SEV2: Delivery portal degraded, notifications failing
  → Priority response within 24 hours

- SEV3: Minor issues, UI bugs
  → Batched resolution cycle

---

## 4. Support Workflows

Standard Flow:

1. Ticket Created
- User submits issue with screenshots/log context

2. Auto-Triage
- System tags category: Payment / Booking / Upload / Access

3. Human Response
- Initial acknowledgment + next action

4. Resolution or Escalation
- Engineering escalation only for SEV1/SEV2

5. Closure + Feedback
- User rates support experience

---

## 5. Emergency Wedding Mode (Phase 2 Moat)

Future Enterprise Feature:

"Wedding Day Emergency Support"

- Temporary hotline access during shoot weekends
- Guaranteed rapid response window

This is a premium moat for agencies.

---

## 6. Trust Doctrine

Software breaks.
Trust breaks harder.

Support is the bridge between failure and forgiveness.
