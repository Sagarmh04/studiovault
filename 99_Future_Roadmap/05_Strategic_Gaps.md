# Strategic Product Gaps (The "Missing Giants")
*Status: IDENTIFIED but DEFERRED. To be designed in Phase 3.*

## 1. The Marketing Engine (Revenue Generator)
* **The Gap:** We have a Client Database (CRM), but no way to *activate* them.
* **Missing Features:**
    * **Campaign Manager:** Bulk SMS/WhatsApp sender (e.g., "Festival Offer: 20% Off").
    * **Drip Automations:** Trigger-based sequences (e.g., "Send 'Thank You' 2 days after Project Completion").
    * **Audience Builder:** Smart segments (e.g., "Clients who spent >₹1L last year" OR "Maternity clients from 2024").
    * **ROI Tracker:** Linking a "Campaign ID" to specific "Invoices" to measure ad spend efficiency.

## 2. The Production House Workflow (Video Ops)
* **The Gap:** Our current "Project" model works for Photos (Single delivery), but fails for Video (Iterative drafts).
* **Missing Features:**
    * **Version Control:** Tracking `v1_Draft`, `v2_Color`, `v3_Final`.
    * **Review Interface:** Frame.io-style video player where clients can leave timestamped comments.
    * **Post-Production Pipeline:** Passing a job card from "Shooter" -> "Editor" -> "Colorist" -> "Sound Engineer".

## 3. The Vendor Portal (External Collaborators)
* **The Gap:** Freelancers currently live in a static list. They have no login/upload access.
* **Missing Features:**
    * **"Limited" Login:** A dashboard showing *only* the specific job assigned to that freelancer.
    * **Raw Upload:** Allowing freelancers to dump footage directly into the Project bucket without seeing the client's financial data.
    * **Invoice Submission:** Freelancers uploading *their* invoice to us for approval.
