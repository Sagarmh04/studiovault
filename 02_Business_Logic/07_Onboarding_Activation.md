Onboarding & Activation (The First Successful Booking)

StudioVault is only valuable once a studio reaches operational momentum.

Activation is defined as:

- A real client booking created
- Media delivered through the portal
- Payment lifecycle completed

This document defines the Phase 1 onboarding funnel.

---

## 1. Activation North Star

A studio is considered "Activated" when:

1. Branch is created successfully
2. First Active Project is booked
3. Client delivery portal is shared
4. Client satisfaction rating is collected

Until these occur, retention is unlikely.

---

## 2. Onboarding Phases (Phase 1)

### Phase A: Identity Setup (5 minutes)

Required Steps:
- Studio creates Branch profile
- Sets:
  - Location name
  - Contact number
  - Invoice tax settings (optional at start)

System Outcome:
- Branch subdomain becomes live:
  [brand].studiovault.in

---

### Phase B: First Package Setup (10 minutes)

Studios must define at least one sellable package:

Example:
- Wedding Shoot – 8 Hours – ₹25,000

Minimum Fields:
- Name
- Price
- Resource needs (optional in MVP)

Outcome:
Booking engine becomes usable immediately.

---

### Phase C: First Booking Creation (Activation Event)

Paths:

1. Manual Staff Booking (Event) creates Active Project
- POS Walk-ins do not create projects

2. Online Inquiry Flow
- Client requests quote → studio accepts → project becomes Active

Outcome:
Project enters Active lifecycle and counts toward Free tier cap.

---

### Phase D: First Upload & Delivery

Free Tier Rule:
- Proxy uploads only via Smart Select Desktop Bridge

Pro Tier Rule:
- RAW + full uploads supported

Client Delivery Portal:
- studiovault.in/view/[project-id]

Activation Moment:
Client successfully views gallery.

---

### Phase E: Payment Completion

Payment success triggers:
- Booking hard lock confirmed
- Watermark removal (if unpaid previously)
- Revenue recognized

---

## 3. Time-to-Value Targets

Phase 1 goal:

- First Booking within 24 hours of signup
- First Delivery within 7 days
- Upgrade decision within 30 days

These are the operational heartbeat metrics.

---

## 4. Upgrade Triggers (Designed, Not Accidental)

Primary upgrade pressures:

- Active Project cap (3)
- Storage expansion beyond 2GB
- White-label branding removal
- Advanced analytics + governance

Upgrade is framed as "scale readiness", not paywall punishment.

---

## 5. Onboarding Guardrails

To prevent abandonment:

- System provides guided checklist:
  [ ] Create Branch
  [ ] Add Package
  [ ] Create First Booking
  [ ] Upload via Smart Select
  [ ] Share Portal Link

- Support nudges only on stuck milestones
- No spam automations without opt-in

---

## 6. Trust Doctrine

Studios do not adopt platforms.
They adopt momentum.

Onboarding is the bridge from curiosity to dependence.
