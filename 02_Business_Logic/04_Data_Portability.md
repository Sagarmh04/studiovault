Data Portability & Compliance

StudioVault is designed around user ownership of data.
We retain customers through quality, not by holding data hostage.

Billing is invoice-based. No internal wallet balances exist.

---

## 1. Context

Requirement:
Compliance with GDPR and Indian DPDP Act.

Principle:
Easy Exit.

Users must be able to export and delete their data cleanly.

---

## 2. The "Takeout" Module

Location:
Settings → Data Management → Export My Data

Export Formats:
- Client List: CSV (portable CRM import)
- Financials: PDF invoices + CSV ledger exports
- Project Metadata: JSON (machine-readable)
- Media Archive: Optional ZIP export (large projects)

Security:
- Export links are sent only to the Owner account
- 2FA required for sensitive exports

---

## 3. Data Deletion (Right to be Forgotten)

User Action:
Delete Account

System Process:
- Account enters Suspended state for 30 days (recoverable)
- After Day 30: Personally Identifiable Information is scrubbed

Retention Exception:
- Financial transaction records retained 7 years (anonymized) for tax compliance

---

## 4. Billing Overdue & Final Export Safeguard

StudioVault does not maintain stored-value wallets.

If invoices remain unpaid:

- Grace period: 7 days after due date
- After grace: Uploads blocked + delivery portal frozen

Final Safeguards:
- Day 45: Final warning issued
- Day 45: One-click Export ZIP provided
- Day 60: Storage eligible for deletion if unpaid

This policy is explicitly disclosed in Terms of Service.
